# Modified PolypSegNet for Polyp-Segmentation of Colonoscopy Images

## Overview

This project focuses on enhancing polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images using a modified version of PolypSegNet. Accurate segmentation of polyps is crucial for the early detection and treatment of colorectal cancer. The modified PolypSegNet model integrates advanced deep learning techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of polyp detection and segmentation, making it a valuable tool for medical professionals.

## Objectives

- **Enhance Segmentation Accuracy:** Improve the precision of polyp segmentation by refining the PolypSegNet architecture and incorporating advanced image processing techniques.
- **Optimize Model Performance:** Reduce computational complexity and improve the inference time of the model, enabling real-time applications in clinical settings.
- **Facilitate Medical Diagnosis:** Provide a robust tool for medical practitioners to assist in the early detection of colorectal polyps, potentially reducing the incidence of colorectal cancer.

## Key Features

- **Modified Architecture:** An improved version of the PolypSegNet model with enhancements in convolutional layers and attention mechanisms to better capture the features of polyps.
- **Advanced Preprocessing:** Utilizes state-of-the-art image preprocessing techniques to enhance the quality of colonoscopy images and improve model performance.
- **Real-time Segmentation:** Designed for real-time segmentation, allowing immediate analysis during colonoscopy procedures.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieves superior segmentation accuracy compared to traditional methods, reducing false positives and negatives.

## Model Architecture

The modified PolypSegNet architecture includes:

- **Convolutional Layers:** Enhanced with additional filters and depth to capture complex features of polyps.
- **Attention Mechanisms:** Integrated attention mechanisms to focus on relevant areas of the image, improving segmentation accuracy.
- **Skip Connections:** Utilizes skip connections to retain spatial information and improve the accuracy of the segmentation boundaries.
- **Multi-scale Processing:** Processes images at multiple scales to capture polyps of varying sizes and shapes.

## Dataset

The model is trained and evaluated using publicly available colonoscopy image datasets, which include a diverse set of images with varying polyp shapes, sizes, and textures. The datasets are preprocessed to enhance image quality and ensure consistency in model training.

## Performance Metrics

The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Dice Coefficient:** Measures the overlap between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth.
- **Intersection over Union (IoU):** Quantifies the accuracy of the segmented regions.
- **Precision and Recall:** Evaluates the model's ability to accurately identify polyps while minimizing false positives and negatives.
